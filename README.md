Enterprise Resource Management System (ERMSystem)
Overview
The Enterprise Resource Management System (ERMSystem) is a comprehensive, scalable, and maintainable management solution tailored for utility companies and similar enterprises. It enables efficient management of critical resources, including:
Employee Management and Scheduling: Track employee profiles, roles, and schedules.

Asset Tracking and Maintenance: Monitor physical assets (e.g., machinery, vehicles) and their maintenance history.

Inventory Management: Manage stock levels of parts and tools.

Automated Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports and insights on operations.

Document Management with Version Control: Store and track documents with version history.

This project showcases expertise in modern software development practices, utilizing C# with ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, and clean architecture principles (SOLID). It incorporates unit and integration testing, role-based access control (RBAC), and follows best practices for enterprise-grade software.
Features
Backend: Built with ASP.NET Core Web API for robust, RESTful endpoints.

Database: Leverages SQL Server with Entity Framework Core for efficient data persistence and querying.

Architecture: Implements clean architecture with separation of concerns across Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers.

Security: Includes role-based access control to ensure data integrity and restrict access based on user roles.

Scalability: Designed with modularity to handle enterprise-level workloads and future expansions.

Technical Stack
Languages & Frameworks:
- C# with ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
Database:
- SQL Server
Development Tools:
- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET CLI
Testing:
- xUnit or NUnit
Version Control:
- Git, GitHub

Application Layer:
Orchestrates business logic through services (e.g., EmployeeService) and DTOs.

References the Domain layer for entities and interfaces.

Infrastructure Layer:
Manages data persistence (e.g., Entity Framework Core with SQL Server) and external integrations.

Implements repository interfaces and the unit of work pattern.

API Layer:
Exposes RESTful endpoints via ASP.NET Core Web API.

Includes controllers, middleware, and configuration for HTTP handling.

Dependency Flow
Dependencies flow inward:
API depends on Application and Infrastructure.

Application depends on Domain.

Infrastructure depends on Domain and Application.

Cross-Cutting Concerns
Logging: System-wide logging for debugging and monitoring.

Error Handling: Centralized exception management.

Security: Authentication and authorization using JWT and RBAC.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
.NET SDK: Version 8.0 or later (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

SQL Server: SQL Server 2019 or later (or SQL Server Express for development)

Visual Studio: 2022 or later with ASP.NET and web development workload

Git: For cloning the repository

Installation
Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ERMSystem.git
cd ERMSystem
```
Restore Dependencies:
Open the solution in Visual Studio or use the .NET CLI:
bash

dotnet restore

#### 3. Configure the Database

- Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` (located in `ERMSystem.API`):

```bash 
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=UtilityResourceManagement;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```
Run EF Core migrations to create the database:
```bash

dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --project ERMSystem.Infrastructure --startup-project ERMSystem.API
dotnet ef database update --project ERMSystem.Infrastructure --startup-project ERMSystem.API
```
Run the Application:
Open the solution in Visual Studio and set ERMSystem.API as the startup project.

Press F5 to run, or use the CLI:
```bash

dotnet run --project ERMSystem.API
```
Usage
Access the API via Swagger at https://localhost:<port>/swagger (port number depends on your launch settings).

Use POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE endpoints to manage employees, assets, inventory, etc.

For a frontend, you can build an Angular application to consume these endpoints (instructions for frontend setup can be added later).

Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance ERMSystem! To contribute:
